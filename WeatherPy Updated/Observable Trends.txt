1) Temperature increases as latitudes approach zero. This is more
   pronounced in cities in the northern hemisphere, but this may owe
   in part to seasonality - it is currently summer in the southern
   hemisphere.

2) Humidity is less affected by latitude, though there does seem to
   be a concentration of humidity around 80% in cities around 55°
   latitude.

3) Cloudiness does not seem affected by latitude.

4) Wind speed seems to have more extremes in the most northerly
   and southerly cities - though the case for the southernmost
   cities is weaker.
